![Global terrorism Analysis Dashboard](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d2af9fb0-1d3c-40f0-a115-50e6fa733873)

From **1970 to 2017**, terrorism evolved into a more **frequent**, **organized**, and **geographically concentrated** threat.  
The data reveals a **dramatic surge** in attacks after **2013**, peaking in **2017** — driven largely by **conflicts in the Middle East** and the rise of extremist groups like **ISIL** and the **Taliban**.

---

## Key Insights

- **Epicenters of Violence**  
  Iraq, Pakistan, and Afghanistan account for the highest attack volumes, reflecting prolonged instability and insurgency.

- **Tactics & Weapons**  
  Explosives dominate as the most used and most effective weapon, followed by armed assaults and assassinations.

- **Targets**  
  Private citizens, government institutions, and police forces are the most frequently and successfully attacked, showing both symbolic and civilian-focused strategies.

- **Groups**  
  The Taliban remains the deadliest, with ISIL, Boko Haram, and Shining Path also showing sustained operational success.

---

## Strategic Implications

Counterterrorism must focus on:
1. **Regional hotspots**  
2. **Disrupting explosive-based attacks**  
3. **Protecting civilian populations** — not just state assets.

---

**Conclusion:** Terrorism thrives where instability, ideology, and capability intersect — and it adapts faster than many responses can keep up.
